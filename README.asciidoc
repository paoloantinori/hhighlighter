== hhighlighter (or just h)

A tiny utility to highlight multiple keywords with different colors

- Idea: Paolo Antinori
- Based on: *ack* - http://beyondgrep.com/ written by Andy Lester

=== Description

*h* (hhighlighter is just a name to help search engines) is a really tiny helper script meant to highlight keywords in the output of another *nix command:


=== Requirements

*h* is just a tiny facade in front of *ack* so you need to install it first.

*What is ack?*

*ack* is a tool like *grep*, optimized for programmers

Designed for programmers with large heterogeneous trees of source code, ack is written purely in portable Perl 5 and takes advantage of the power of Perl's regular expressions.

see: http://beyondgrep.com/

*ack installation*

*ack* is part of many major linux distributions so you should use your *package manager* to install it.

see: http://beyondgrep.com/install/

If you want to install *ack* in a *portable* way ( at the end ack is just a script ) you do it in this way:

`curl http://beyondgrep.com/ack-2.08-single-file > ~/bin/ack && chmod 0755 !#:3`


=== Installation Instructions

*h* is implemented as a function in *bash*.

You can install it in *one of these ways*:

- copy and paste `h()` function in you `~/.bashrc`
- configure your `~/.bashrc` to load the external script with `. /path/to/h.sh`

=== Platform Specifics

*h* has currently been tested only on *bash* and *zsh* on *Linux*.

=== Usage

*h* is meant to consume the output of another Linux command via pipe

```
$ h
usage: YOUR_COMMAND | h [-i] [-d] args...
	-i : ignore case
	-d : disable regexp
	-n : invert colors
```


=== Examples

.Available colors
----
echo "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxywz" | h   a b c d e f g h i j k l
----

.Invert colors
----
echo "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxywz" | h -n   a b c d e f g h i j k l
----

.Support for `tail` in follow mode
----
tail -F | h keyword1 keyword2
----

.Case Insensitive
----
mvn clean install | h -i failure success
----
